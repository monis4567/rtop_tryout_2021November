Use the R package rtop to interpolate along rivers in Norway

The aim is to get the 'rtop' package for R to interpolate along rivers in Norway. Input data should be x,y, z data. The idea is to plot  the concentrations measured per sample for lat and long positions, while also plotting predicted concentrations for predicted sample sites in the vicinity of the sampled (i.e. observed) sites.
